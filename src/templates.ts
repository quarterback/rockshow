// Doc templates for reviewing AI agent work. The flagship is the Agent Action
// Record: a manager-led, six-part review (Intent, Action, Judgment, Deviation,
// Consequence, Change) that surfaces the decisions an agent made on its own, the
// moments a human should have been in the loop, where it was confidently wrong,
// and what that cost. The record format is the canonical artifact from the
// Agent After-Action Review skill (github.com/quarterback/AAR), here under MIT.
//
// The other templates are lighter task-doc variants for a human-agent team; the
// Agent Action Record is the default and the point. "Outputs are easy to
// measure; judgment is not."

// A labeled field inside a section (the record renders as a form of these).
